standard list of metasyntactic variables:
foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, quuux, ...

thunk (suspension, suspended computation, delayed computation) - a parameterless closure created to prevent the evaluation of an expression until forced at a later time. In lazy langauges, thunks are created and forced implicitly; in eager languages, thunks can be created explicitly by wrapping an expression in a parameterless anonymous function

trampoline - 1. a loop that iteratively invokes thunk-returning function (continuation-passing style); trampolines can be used to implement tail-recursive function calls in stack-oriented programming languages; 2. (java) the use of reflection to avoid inner classes (e.g., event listeners)

fluent interface - an implementation of an object-oriented API that aims to provide more readable code, normally by using method cascading

chord - a set of keys to be pressed simulataneously
combinator - a high-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments
Y combinator
I combinator
K combinator
S combinator
thrush combinator - Txy = yz

code kata - an exercise in programming that helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition
Datensparsamkeit (< Grm, data parsimony/frugality) - 

magic string - an input that a programmer believes will never come externally and that activates otherwise hidden functionality
test fixture (test context) - a fixed state used as a baseline for running tests (e.g., mock objects, mock data in a db)
code coverage - a measure of the extent to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite

alpha-conversion - e.g., (x) => x is alpha-equivalent to (y) => y;
beta-reduction - e.g., ((n) => n * 2) (m) === m * 2;
eta-conversion - e.g., (x) => f (x) is eta-equivalent to f whenever x does not appear free in f;

angelic non-determinism - the kind of execution of a non-deterministic program by which all choices made favor termination
demonic non-determinism - the kind of execution of a non-deterministic program by which all choices made favor non-termination
regression - a software bug that cause a feature to malfunction after an event such as system patching or a change to DST
performance regression - a software bug that causes misuse of resources like memory
anaphoric macro - a type of programming macro that deliberately captures some form supplied to the macro which then may be referred to by an anaphor (e.g., Lisp's loop)
connascence - a relationship between elements of software in which changing one necessitates changing the others to maintain overall correctness

null-coalescing operator - a binary operator that returns the second argument if the first is null
Elvis operator - a null-coalescing variant of a ternary conditional operator (often represented as ?:)
spaceship operator - a binary relational operator (<=>) that returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the value of the left argument relative to that of the right.

Tennet's correspondence principle - x should be equivalent to ((\i -> x)())
call site - the location (line of code) where a function is called (or possibily called via dynamic dispatch); an abstract point of code that accepts arguments and possibly returns values

dynamic dispatch - the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation to call at runtime
decomposition (factoring) - the process by which a complex problem or system is broken down into parts that are easier to conceive and maintain

code refactoring - the process by of restructuring existing computer code -- changing the factoring -- without changing its external behavior; typically, the application of a series of standardized micro-refactorings, which do not affect conformance to functional requirements

functional requirement -
nonfunctional requirement -

three pounds of VAX - a coding prescript that advises that program design stem primarily from experience, intutition, and contextual pragmatism
greenfield project - a project without constraints imposed by prior work
user story - one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function; an informal statement of the requirment of an acceptance-test specification

Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) - a X11 display server that performs all graphical operations in memory without showing any screen output

test fixture (test harness) - sets up and tears down test dependencies, such as database connections, etc.
CRC card [Class, Responsibility, Collaboration] - a brainstorming tool used in OOP

heisenberg - a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior as attempts to study it are made
yoda conditions - e.g., "if (52 == value)" rather than "if (value == 52)"
hot potato - a colloquial pronunciation of 'http'

SOLID principles:
	1. single responsibility
	2. open/closed - software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification; create stable interfaces areound points of predicted variation
	3. Liskov substitution - replacing an instance of a type with an instance of a subtype should be permissible
	4. interface segmentation - many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
	5. dependency inversion - depend on abstractions, not on concrete instances
Open/Closed principle - changing the behavior of a software entity (e.g., classes, modules, functions) should be possible without altering the source code
Inteface-Segregation principle - 

discriminated union (also tagged union, variant, or disjoint union) - a data structure used to hold a value that can take on different but fixed types

snake case - e.g., this_is_an_example
camel case - e.g., thisIsAnExample
Pascal case - e.g, ThisIsAnExample
train case - e.g., This-is-an-example
spinal case - e.g., this-is-an-example
screaming snake case - e.g., THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE

kloc - a unit of code length such that 1 kloc = 1000 lines of code

defect density - the number of errors per kloc

nibble - a unit of measure such that 1 nibble = 4 bits

fragile-base-class problem - a fundamental architectural problem of OOP characterized by base classes that are difficult to modify because of subclass dependencies

hot-linking (inline linking) - the use of a linked object, often an image, from one site by a webpage belonging to a second site

open recursion - dynamic recursion with late binding
